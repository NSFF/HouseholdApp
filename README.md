# HouseholdApp
This project is a Xamarin/ASP.NET/.NET group project where we build a website which is also integrated into an App. It has to show/add/delete/update Household groups buying groceries. This project was made in 2020.

The project was too big to upload through the UI of github and I am too lazy to commit it locally and push it online. So if you want this code, contact me through Linkedin.
